**Why?**

Because Flutter is a great way to create a fast and stylish user interface in a declarative form and run it on both mobile platforms. It is an interesting technology that has a future.

**Purposes of creating this repository and how it can help me and you**

All screens are separated in custom stateless widgets that can be reused, modified and upgraded to statefull versions. It is like pack of UI components with examples of its using.

**Screens organization**

Every part of this sample is one of few designs from different sources like [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/mobile), or public profiles of Design Studios like [Cuberto](https://www.instagram.com/cubertodesign/) and [Construct](https://www.instagram.com/construct.cc/).

**Mini-TODO**: Make gifs for all screens

**Stay inspired!**
